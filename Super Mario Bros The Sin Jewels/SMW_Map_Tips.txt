-- PATHING --
If making a path:

0.) Before making a path here are some important reminders while making one.

	[A.]
	
				  	 To go UP, you must make the Y coordinate NEGATIVE or LOWER [ex. (0, -32)]

        						 	       /\  
  To go LEFT, make the X coordinate NEGATIVE or LOWER [ex.(-64, 0)]  <=||=>  To go RIGHT, you must make the X coordinate POSITVE or HIGHER [ex.(96,  0)]
								       \/

				   	To go DOWN, you must make the Y coordniate POSITIVE OR HIGHER [ex. (0, 128)]

  So in simplified terms:
  		               ^		
Use NEGATIVE numbers (-1,-2)   |		
  		     	    <----->
 		               |    Use POSITIVE numbers (1,2)
  		               v

	[B.]

       X | Y  <-- coordinates correspondent to the numbers
      (32,64) 

1.) The Starting point should be 32 pixels BACKWARDS into where the level point is placed.
Example: (-32,0) -- Here the level path is going from the RIGHT side of the starting level point so we put a -32 to put the starting point of the path in the SAME SPOT as said level point.

2.) The Ending point should end 32 pixels (1 block) NEXT from where the end of the ending level point is placed THEN add 2 pixels TOWARDS it.
Example (-32,0 , 288,0) -> *Add 2 pixels towards ending level area* -> (-32,0 , 290,0) -- Here the second coordinates moved the path by 32 x 9 pixels (9 blocks) then we added 2 more towards the ending level point
